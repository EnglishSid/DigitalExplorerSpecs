The 5D models are an instrumental element within the Digital Transformation approach from DXC; with a strong tie within the existing content and methods within the Digital Explorer platform here we discuss the potential to embed/integrate/share approaches and content.


**Initial Proposal**
* 5D reference content is hosted on the Digital Explorer site - "whitepapers and key content section" (already planned)
* DE industry trends called out in 5d playbook as key reference point to "understand" 

**short term activities**
* review 5D content and build potential data map between DE trends and 5d content


**Long term goal**
* Dynamic 5D models
* 5D master editor
* client 5D model editor - clone from master, toggle relevant capabilities, extend(?)
* 5D model export (PDF/PPTX)


**Risks**
esource levels within the Digital Explorer team are too low to give priority to this work, i am discussing with the leadership team in Poland the potential to return the team to the full resource level of 5, currently we have 3.
