# DXC Digital Explorer Taxonomy

The DXC taxonomies form a key part of the data structure within DXC Digital Explorer, the key elements from the taxonomy are

1. Industry model
2. Offerings
3. Regions


## Industry Models
The industry model is composed of 2 (currently) taxonomies within DXC

**Baseline industry model**

`Industry` and `SubIndustry`

**Business Value Framework**
Each relevant `business area` or `value chain` is defined within the DXC Business Value Framework, this 3rd level 


## Trends and Industry models
Business trends are connected to the `business area` within the industry model, this ensures consistency across the platform and matching and building client roadmaps within the core modules of Digital Explorer.


## Taxonomy API's
Digital Explorer can provide other solutions access to these key taxonomies via a set of API's, see the detailed guide on access the Digital Explorer API's [here](../DEAPI's/readme.md)



##  Roadmap
Currently the taxonomies are managed manually and aligned with the corporate master maintained [here](https://my.dxc.com/our-company/global-functions/integrated-workforce-management/infrastructure-and-support/knowledge-management/km_taxonomy_classification.html)<br>

The long term plan is to pull all elements of the taxonomy from the central taxonomy platform (PoolParty), which is currently being rolled out.
