# Agenda FAQ

## Q : I have a trend which evolves during the lifetime of my innovation agenda, do I need to create a new signal or should I reuse the same trend twice?

A : Use the same trend and position it within the correct time segments in your agenda.
Optionally - rename the name and description of your placed trend

### Example : PSD2 in 2018 potentially evolves to PSD2 with stronger authentication in 2019 and 2020
