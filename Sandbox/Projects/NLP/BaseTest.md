SET n.text ="Prime Minister Theresa May has set out what she called hard facts about leaving the European Union, as she delivers her big Brexit speech. We are leaving the single market, life is going to be different, she told an audience at London s Mansion House. Access to each others markets would be less than it is now, she acknowledged. But she added that the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK must end. Mrs May is outlining what the UK wants from its economic relationship with the EU after Brexit. She started by setting out five tests for the negotiations and pledge to bring our country together. She said both sides needed to accept that neither side can have exactly what we want but she was confident that an agreement can be found.  Work together The PM said the deal on access to each other s markets had to be on fair terms - with the need for binding commitments. For example, we may choose to commit some areas of our regulations like state aid and competition to remaining in step with the EU s, she said. Media captionTheresa May: We must bring our country back together She said the UK wanted the freedom to negotiate trade deals, control of laws and as frictionless a border as possible with the EU but said any disputes about the future relationship could not be ruled on by the court of either party. On the Northern Irish border, Mrs May rejected suggestions the UK could decide alone not to impose a hard border with the Republic of Ireland: It is not good enough to say we won t introduce a hard border; if the EU forces Ireland to do it, that s down to them .We chose to leave; we have a responsibility to help find a solution. But we can t do it on our own. It is for all of us to work together. But she also said the EU would have to accept some hard facts as well, saying: The [European] commission has suggested that the only option available to the UK is an off-the-shelf model. But, at the same time, they have also said that in certain areas, none of the EU s third country agreements would be appropriate.  Amid criticism from the EU that the UK was attempting to cherry-pick the best parts of the bloc s rules, she said: The fact is that every free trade agreement has varying market access depending on the respective interests of the countries involved. If this is cherry-picking, then every trade arrangement is cherry-picking. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but it wants a transition period lasting around two years after that, intended to smooth the way to the future post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU. The speech has been relocated from Newcastle to the Mansion House in central London, because of severe weather.";

SET n.text ="Tony Blair has urged European leaders to reform the EU so British people  change their mind  about Brexit.  The former prime minister argued that if  comprehensive  immigration reforms are offered, voters will realise their  genuine underlying grievances  can be addressed.He thinks Brexit can then be  averted  via another referendum, this time on the final deal reached with the EU. Mr Blair, who opposed Brexit, also said Northern Ireland could be at risk.  Speaking to BBC Radio 4 s Today programme, he said:  I find it not just disappointing but sickening that people should really be prepared to sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit. Brexit campaigners dismissed his remarks.  Former prime ministers who no longer believe in our great nation are engaged in a desperate last ditch attempt to defy the largest democratic mandate ever in the UK,  said Leave Means Leave s Richard Tice.  Disgracefully, they are using the Irish border as their proxy, ignoring the technological solutions that solve the issue. Mr Blair s speech, in Brussels, was the second warning about leaving the EU by a former prime minister in two days, following Sir John Major s intervention on Wednesday. He said that Labour should  say what it really believes  on Brexit - which was that leaving the EU will  make problems worse . If he was still in charge, he said,  I would be hammering the Tories all the time  on the  destructive impact  of Brexit.  We could be making that case so forcefully,  he added. Mr Blair earlier set out the three steps he said could lead to a  reconsideration of Brexit  These are firstly showing voters that Brexit  has turned out much more complex and costly than they had thought , secondly, responding to their grievances, especially around immigration, and thirdly the EU accepting the vote as a  wake-up call  to change.  Reform in Europe is key to getting Britain to change its mind,  he told the European Policy Centre think tank, calling for  a comprehensive plan on immigration control, which preserves Europe s values but is consistent with the concerns of its people and includes sensitivity to the challenges of the freedom of movement principle .  He also wants a  roadmap for future European reform.  Conservative MP Nigel Huddleston hit back, tweeting:  As Tony Blair lectures today s politicians on what we should be doing on Brexit one wonders if he has the self-awareness to realise one of the key reasons we are leaving the EU is because of his inability to control immigration when he was PM for a decade.   Media captionTony Blair tells Today people are  sacrificing peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit   Mr Blair s views on Brexit are not shared by the present-day leadership of the Labour Party - Jeremy Corbyn says the result should be respected and is not calling for a second referendum.  Speaking on the Today programme, Mr Blair said Mr Corbyn s recent commitment to a customs union with the EU was  sensible , but warned Labour will  very soon find that we ve got to move further in order to escape the dilemma ourselves .  On Friday Prime Minister Theresa May will deliver a major speech setting out the UK s strategy for the next phase of the negotiations, including striking a new free trade deal with Brussels. On Wednesday she attacked EU proposals for Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union, saying they undermined the UK s constitutional integrity.  Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has suggested the row about Northern Ireland is being stoked by people who want to  frustrate  Brexit.";

SET n.text ="Spotify says its value could be more than $23bn (£16.7bn).  The streaming giant has filed for paperwork to start trading its shares publicly on the New York Stock Exchange.   It s used in 61 countries, has 159 million active users and a library of 35 million songs.  So how has a Swedish music service, launched in 2008, grown to be the biggest streaming platform in the world?  Founded by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, Spotify actually started as a small start-up in Stockholm, Sweden.  They developed the platform in 2006 as a response to the growing piracy problem the music industry was facing.  Launching two years later, Spotify offered music fans a free service with advertising, in hopes they would upgrade to the £10 a month ad-free subscription.  Before streaming services came along you might have been guilty of using controversial file sharing sites like Napster, LimeWire and The Pirate Bay to download your music.  This cost the music industry millions each year because well - you re not paying for the songs.  I realised that you can never legislate away from piracy,  Daniel told The Telegraph in 2010.  The only way to solve the problem was to create a service that was better than piracy and at the same time compensates the music industry.   He also had a slight hunch his streaming service would one day be worth  tens of billions .  But it wasn t long before other platforms tried to get in on the streaming action.  The company s main rival Apple Music arrived in 2015. It secured exclusive deals with artists like Drake, Frank Ocean and Taylor Swift to stream their music first.  Apple s iTunes store had always allowed users to pay per download of a song or album.  But Apple Music introduced paying a monthly subscription for unlimited access to a library of music.  It s not the only platform to adapt its original business model to make room for streaming. SoundCloud launched SoundCloud Go in 2016.  The company expanded from being a platform solely for new and unsigned musicians and DJs to share their work.  However its success has often been questioned as it only has half of the major label content found on Spotify and has to compete against other big names.  Despite its success, Spotify s rise to the top hasn t been without a few bumps in the road.  Spotify works by getting its content from major record labels as well as independent artists - and pays the artists, songwriters and label royalties for streamed music.  Taylor Swift was one of the first artists to publicly speak out against Spotify for how much it paid artists - calling the whole platform an  experiment .  I m not willing to contribute my life s work to an experiment that I don t feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists, and creators of this music, she told Yahoo. But Spotify were hopeful she d be back one day, saying:  We hope she ll change her mind and join us in building a new music economy that works for everyone.   Last year the singer ended her three-year feud with Spotify and put all her music back on the platform.  Jay Z was another artist that backed this claim. So he became a rival by launching his own music streaming service, Tidal, in 2016.  Most of his and his wife Beyonce s music is still only exclusively on Tidal.  It gave us its digital offering first, but in recent years Spotify has been focusing more on putting on live events.  It s followed in the footsteps of Apple with its take on live gigs.  And with hip hop now the most popular genre in the world, in February it announced it would be hiring a team to work specifically on live events for urban and Latin music. Even so, tech companies like Apple, Amazon and Google are continuing to develop their streaming services. They ve come out with speakers, home assistants and tablets which allow people to use their streaming apps directly with the brands  own products. This is something Spotify has yet to crack";
